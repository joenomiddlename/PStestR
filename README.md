# PStestR
PStestR is an R package for testing for preferential sampling in spatio-temporal data. This includes discrete (i.e. areal) and continuous (i.e. point-referenced) data. The package is compatible with many popular R packages for handling spatial data including the spatstat, sp, and sf packages.

PStestR uses two functions: PSTestInit and PSTestRun. The first is a helper function for creating an object in the neccessary format for the test. The second function implements the test. 

To use PStestR, read the tutorials found in the comprehensive vignette provided.
