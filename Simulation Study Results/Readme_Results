This folder contains all the simulation study results, including plots. All plots can be re-created using the simulation study scripts. Note that the large number contained in the names are the (random) seed used to generate the results. The folder 'New_Tests' contains all the continuous space IPP and Hardcore PP simulation results. The 'Discrete' folder contains the results from the discrete-space simulation study. Finally, the 'N_eff_corrected' folder contains the results from the (failed) attempt to use an effective sample size-corrected simulation-free approach.
